<center><h2>MAJOR ANDRE.</h2></center>
<br><br>
<p>MAJOR ANDRE (when Captain Andre) was captured at St. John's, Upper
Canada, by Gen'l Montgomery, on the 3d of November, 1775, and, with other
British officers, sent to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, as a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>Caleb Cope was then residing in that place, and filling the office of a
Burgess.  He was a member of the Society of Friends, a non-combatant of
course, and more disposed to yield to the pretensions of the British
Government than to engage in a bloody war,--believing that there would
still be remaining blessings enough to be thankful for.  It was under
these circumstances that he offered the prisoners a shelter under his
roof, when it seemed impossible for them to obtain accommodations
elsewhere.  This act required the exercise of no little moral courage, as
the populace were greatly excited against the prisoners, and soon gave
evidence of their hostility by destroying every window in the house of
their generous benefactor,--an act of violence, however, which was fully
redeemed in after-years, when the people of Lancaster liberally assisted
the unfortunate owner in the reconstruction of his dwelling, which had
been accidentally destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>Among the children of Andre's benevolent host, there was one named John,
then aged about thirteen years, in whom the former felt deeply
interested.  He had displayed a remarkable talent for drawing, as the
letters of Andre show.  This boy was the brother of Thomas P. Cope,
Israel Cope, and Jasper Cope, and the father of Herman Cope, in whose
possession the following letters and picture now are.  All the brothers
(including a fourth one named William) were then living under the same
roof with Andre, and the elder ones were frequently entertained by him in
games of marbles and other youthful sports.</p>

<p>The "Mr. Despard" spoken of by Andre was the Col.  Despard who in
subsequent years became famous.  His name was Edward Marcus Despard, an
Irishman by birth, who, after having served till 1779 in the American
war, was transferred in that year to Jamaica, and soon thereafter
assisted in wresting the possessions on the Mosquito Coast from the
Spanish Government.  He was afterwards invested with executive power in
these colonies, but was superseded in his authority in consequence of
disagreements with the people whom he governed.  He returned to England,
however, in 1790, with distinguished honors; but, unsuccessfully
preferring extensive claims against the government, he yielded his
loyalty to it, and headed a conspiracy having for its object the murder
of his King and a seizure of the reins of government.  His associates in
this insane effort were of the lowest character; and six of them,
together with their leader, expiated their guilt upon the scaffold.  This
was in his year 1802.  Thus did the friend of Andre, though in a
different cause,--the one being in rebellion against his King, the other
engaged in his service,--meet with a like ignominious end.</p>

<p>I have heard the venerable Caleb Cope say that he had prophesied
Despard's fate, from his impetuous and unconciliating temper and
disposition.  Of their mutual friend Andre he entertained wholly
different anticipations; and, though many years had rolled by since they
parted, this aged protector of the renowned and unfortunate soldier never
failed to weep at the remembrance of his name.</p>

<p>Lieut. Hughes was also, as will appear from his letters, an inmate of the
house I have referred to.  The B---n alluded to in one of his letters was
probably one of the "Lebanon gentlemen" spoken of by Andre, and who,
notwithstanding what he says, there seems reason to believe had violated
his parole.</p>

<p>I have been informed by one of the sons of my grandfather, Caleb Cope,
that another letter was written by Major Andre, then Adjutant-General of
the British army, about nine days before his last capture.  It was dated
at New York, and included the following remark:--"To-morrow I expect to
meet Sir Harry Clinton, and make up for lost time."  Considering poor
Andre's fate, these words are memorable.</p>

<p>Whilst Andre was a prisoner at Lancaster, he proposed to the father of
his "young disciple," as he called the boy-artist, to take the latter to
England and educate him at his own expense for the profession of a
painter.  For this purpose (as he alleged) he proposed to sell his
commission; and on more than one occasion he stated that he had
opportunities to dispose of it.  Andre's friends believed that he longed
to return to England, on account of his love-affair with Honora Sneyd,
(afterwards the wife of Richard Lovell Edgeworth,) and that he made this
proposition his excuse for abandoning the service.</p>

<p>His offer (I need scarcely say) was gratefully declined, on conscientious
grounds, after the counsel had been sought of esteemed and reliable
friends.  A most unfortunate decision for both preceptor and pupil!</p>

<h3>
                        LETTERS FROM MAJOR ANDRE.</h3></center>
<br><br>
<p>PHILADELPHIA, October, 1859.</p>

<p>C. C.</p>

<p>SIR,</p>

<p>You wou'd have heard from me ere this time had I not wish'd to be able to
give you some encouragement to send my young friend John to Carlisle.  My
desire was to find a lodging where I cou'd have him with me, and some
quiet, honest family of Friends, or others, where he might have boarded,
as it wou'd not have been so proper for him to live with a mess of
officers.  I have been able to find neither, and am myself still in a
tavern.  The people here are no more willing to harbour us than those of
Lancaster were at our first coming there.  If, however, you can resolve
to let him come here, I believe Mr. Despard and I can make him up a bed
in a lodging we have in view, where there will be room enough.  He will
be the greatest part of the day with us, or employ'd in the few things I
am able to instruct him in.  In the mean while I may get better
acquainted with the town, and provide for his board.  With regard to
expence, this is to be attended with none to you.  A little assiduity and
friendship is all I ask of my young friend in return for my good will to
be of service to him, and my wishes to put him in the way of improving
the talents Nature hath given him.  I shall give all my attention to his
morals, and as I believe him well-dispos'd, I trust he will acquire no
bad habits here.</p>

<p>Mr. Despard joins with me in compliments to yourself, Mrs. Cope, and
family.</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I am,</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Your most humble servant,</p>

<p>JOHN ANDRE.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<br><br><br><br>



<p>CARLISLE, the 3d April, 1776.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR</p>

<p>I am much oblig'd to you for your kind letter, and to your son for his
drawings.  He is greatly improv'd since I left Lancaster; and I do not
doubt but, if he continues his application, he will make a very great
progress.  I cannot regret that you did not send your son hither.  We
have been submitted to alarms and jealousys which would have render'd his
stay here very disagreeable to him; and I would not willingly see any
person suffer on our account.  With regard, however, to your
apprehensions in consequence of the escape of the Lebanon gentlemen, they
were groundless, as we have been on parole ever since our arrival at this
place, which I can assure you they were not.  I shou'd more than once
have written to you had opportunitys presented themselves; but the post
and we seem to have fallen out; for we can never by that channel receive
or forward a line on the most indifferent subjects.  Mr. Despard is very
well, and desires to be remember'd to yourself and family.  I beg you
wou'd give my most friendly compliments to your family, and particularly
to your son, my disciple, to whom I hope the future posture of affairs
will give me an opportunity of pointing out the way to proficiency in his
favourite study, which may tend so much to his pleasure and advantage.
Let him go on copying whatever good models he can meet with, and never
suffer himself to neglect the proportion, and never to think of finishing
his work or imitating the fine flowing lines of his copy, till every
limb, feature, house, tree, or whatever he is drawing, is in its proper
place.  With a little practise, this will be so natural to him, that his
eye will at first sight guide his pencil in the exact distribution of
every part of the work.  I wish I may soon see you in our way to our own
friends, with whom I hope, by exchange, we may be at length reunited.</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I am,</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Your most obedient, humble servant,</p>

<p>J.  ANDRE.</p>

<br><br>
<p>
CARLISLE, the 2d Septr, 1776.</p>

<p>YOUR letter by Mr. Barrington is just come to hand.  I am sorry you
shou'd imagine my being absent from Lancaster, or our troubles, should
make me forget my friends.  Of the several letters you mention having
written to me, only one, of late, has reach'd Carlisle,--viz. that by Mr.
Hough.  To one I receiv'd from you a week or two after leaving Lancaster,
I return'd an answer.  I own the difficulties of our correspondence had
disgusted me from attempting to write.</p>

<p>I once more commend myself to your good family, and am, sincerely,  Yrs,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>J. A.</p>

<p>I hope your son's indisposition will be of no consequence.</p>

<p>MR. COPE, Lancaster.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br>

<p>
DEAR SIR</p>

<p>I have just time to acquaint you that I receiv'd your letter by Mrs.
Callender, with my young friend's drawings, which persuade me he is much
improv'd, and that he has not been idle.  He must take particular care in
forming the features in faces, and in copying hands exactly.  He shou'd
now and then copy things from the life, and then compare the proportions
with what prints he may have or what rules he may have remember'd.  With
respect to his shading with Indian ink, the anatomical figure is
tolerably well done; but he wou'd find his work smoother and softer were
he to lay the shades on more gradually, not blackening the darkest at
once, but by washing them over repeatedly, and never till the paper is
quite dry.  The figure is very well drawn.</p>

<p>Capt.  Campbell, who is the bearer of this letter, will probably, when at
Lancaster, be able to judge what likelyhood there is of an exchange of
prisoners, which we are told is to take place immediately.  If this
shou'd be without foundation, I shou'd be very glad to see your son here.
Of this you may speak with Captn Campbell; and, if you shou'd determine
upon it, let me know it a few days beforehand, when I shall take care to
settle matters for his reception.</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I am,</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Your most humble servt,</p>

<p>J.  ANDRE.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<br><br><br><br>

<br><br>

<p>CARLISLE, the 11th Oct., 1776.</p>

<p>My best comps, if you please, to your family, and particularly to John.
Mr. Despard begs to be remembered to you.</p>

<p>To Mr. CALEB COPE, Lancaster.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR</p>

<p>I cannot miss the opportunity I have of writing to you by Mr. Slough, to
take leave of yourself and family, and transmit to you my sincere wishes
for your welfare.  We are on our road, (as we believe, to be exchang'd,)
and, however happy this prospect may make me, it doth not render me less
warm in the fate of those persons in this country for whom I had
conceiv'd a regard.  I trust, on your side, you will do me the justice to
remember me with some good will, and that you will be persuaded I shall
be happy if an occasion shall offer of my giving your son some further
hints in the art for which he has so happy a turn.  Desire him, if you
please, to commit my name and my friendship for him to his memory, and
assure him from me that, if he only brings diligence to her assistance,
Nature has open'd him a path to fortune and reputation, and that he may
hope in a few years to enjoy the fruits of his labor.  Perhaps the face
of affairs may so far change that he may once more be within my reach,
when it will be a very great pleasure to me to give him what assistance I
can.</p>

<p>My best compliment, as well as Mr. Despard's, to Mrs. Cope and the rest
of your family.  I am truly,</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>Your most obedt and humbl servant,</p>

<p>READING, the 2d Dec., 1776.  J. ANDRE.</p>

<p>Mr. CALEB COPE, Lancaster.</p>
